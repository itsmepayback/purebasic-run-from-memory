How to use it?

1. Compile the compressor. 

2. Execute it.

3. Select the exe file you want to compress.

4. Choose an output file and click save.

5. Add the compressed executable file to the includebinary section of packed.pb  (if you need to know how to do it, refer to this forum question: http://forums.purebasic.com/english/viewtopic.php?t=11064)

6. in the main function, add a call to startexe with the name you used in the includebinary section (for example, if you specified myexefile: as a name, you would call it like this: StartExe(?myexefile, "")). You can delete the default calls to startexe that the packed.pb file comes with. 

7. repeat the steps 2 to 6 for the number of executables you want to include.

8. Compile packed.pb.



Note: This method only works with 32 bit executables, so make sure that all exe files you include are 32 bit and that you are compiling a 32 bit executable.
If you choose to use the method that runs in the same process as the decompressor, you can only include one executable√©

The final exe file works on both 32 and 64 bit operating systems.
